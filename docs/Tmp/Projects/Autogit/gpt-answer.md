# Multi-Device Git-Syncing: Delete/Edit Conflict Strategy

## Original Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Delete / Edit Scenario

#### Devices and Their States

- 3 Devices connected to the Internet
  - Remote: -
  - Device_1: Online
  - Device_2: Online
  - Device_3: Online

#### Workflow

- Device_1 creates `file.txt` (`Device_1: timestamp 1`)
- Device_1 pushes change to git, and the rest sync it up.
- Device_2 and Device_3 are disconnected from the Internet.
- Device_1 deletes the file.
- Device_2 and Device_3 make changes to the file offline.
- Device 2 reconnects to the Internet.

#### Possible Resolutions

1. **Assume Edit**: If a user edited the deleted file, assume the deletion was not intentional.
2. **Choose-Auto**: Inform the user about the Delete/Edit conflict and allow for choosing whether to keep the edit or delete it.

---

## Edge Cases and Considerations

### 1. Multiple Delete/Edit Conflicts

- **Problem**: Multiple delete/edit conflicts across different files.
- **Solution**: Batch notifications and allow user to resolve all in one go.

### 2. Manual Intervention

- **Problem**: User intervention needed in a daemon.
- **Solution**: Implement a timeout after which a default choice is applied.

### 3. Metadata

- **Problem**: File metadata changes.
- **Solution**: Include metadata in conflict detection and resolution.

### 4. Non-text Files

- **Problem**: Handling binary or non-line-comparable files.
- **Solution**: Implement a separate strategy for these types of files.

### 5. Dependencies Between Files

- **Problem**: Interdependence of files.
- **Solution**: Include dependency checks in conflict resolution.

### 6. Network Partitions and Latency

- **Problem**: Network failures can lead to incorrect state assumptions.
- **Solution**: Implement a health check for network connectivity.

### 7. Versioning and History

- **Problem**: Interaction of version history with conflict resolution.
- **Solution**: Maintain a version history to allow rollbacks.

### 8. Queued Changes

- **Problem**: Multiple changes queued when a device reconnects.
- **Solution**: Process changes in a batch.

### 9. Multiple Users

- **Problem**: Different devices may be used by different users.
- **Solution**: Implement user profiles to better guess intentions.

### 10. Rollback

- **Problem**: User might want to rollback a decision.
- **Solution**: Allow easy reversion to previous states.

---

## Proposed Modifications

### 1. Automate Where Possible

- Implement a smart default based on user behavior patterns, with an option to override.

### 2. Batch Notifications

- If multiple conflicts occur, batch them together and allow the user to resolve them in one go.

### 3. Prioritize Conflicts

- Use logic to prioritize which conflicts to resolve first.

### 4. Timeout

- For manual intervention, implement a timeout after which a default choice is made.

### 5. Detailed Logging

- Keep detailed logs for user review.

### 6. Versioning

- Implement a versioning system to allow user rollbacks.

### 7. File Metadata

- Include file metadata in conflict detection and resolution.
