# codenotes

## Description

This is my small project created for gathering programming notes.
The aim is to write only necesary information, without any digressions and
extensieve narration.

I am open to any suggestions and corrections and collaboration as well.
If you want to contribute, please contact me first.
You can write me at: @happyfishes:matrix.org

**Project is in its early stage, so there is not much content yet.**

## Running the project

To run the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed.
Create a virtual environment and install requirements.txt and then install
[ijavascript](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) kernel for JS notebooks.
