## Differences Between Compilers and Interpeters

### Compiler
- A compiler is a computer program that transforms (translates) source code of a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language). 
- In most cases compilers are used to transform source code into executable program, i.e. they translate code from high-level programming languages into low (or lower) level languages, mostly assembly or machine code.

### Interpeter
- An interpreter is a computer program that executes instructions written in a programming language.
- It can either execute the source code directly or translate the source code in a first step into a more efficient representation and execute this code.
